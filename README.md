JK completed the excellent Google Python Exercises on October 5, 2015.

Google's Python Class: https://developers.google.com/edu/python/

Used the online IDE codeio here:

Completed exercises are here:

Did not bother to clean up the code too much.  Got it to work and that was about it.

The Google Python tutorial was excellent IMHO.
 
Spoiler alert!
