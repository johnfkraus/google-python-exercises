# Brute Force Response


## So far we are doing this:

Analyze the log of failed login attempts.

Determine frequency of failed logins by IP address.

Generate iptables commands to block apparent brute force attacks.


## To do, maybe:

Collect additional info on attackers based on IP address

Block entire networks, not just individual IP addresses
